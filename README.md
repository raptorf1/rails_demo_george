# My first Ruby on Rails project

The first baby steps with the rails framework. A very simple blog application with basic functionality and user authentication using [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise).

Using the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license on this one.

Deployed using Heroku [here](https://george-april-2019.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in).
